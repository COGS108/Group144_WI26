    "Since freshman year, we've been given lots of advice on the multiple factors that go into getting a job post-graduation. However, some mentors give mixed advice, and we want to pinpoint exactly what combination of GPA, professional experience, and extracurriculars makes for the highest likelihood of employment post-graduation. And expanding on this question, we want to tackle this across multiple fields and see whether different students should prioritize certain variables for their own success. After light research, we found many sources that took into account variables such as GPA, internship experience, project experience, technical skills, and soft skills, such as behavioral interviews and networking. While many of these factors may be difficult to quantify in our project, they give us a good starting point for where we should look.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first papers we've looked into was from Bowling Green State University<sup><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"ref1\">1</a></sup>, which largely studied undergraduate business students for the correlation between academic and co-curricular factors and full-time job placement post graduation and starting salaries. Some of their findings were that internship experience, GPA, and area of study were the most accurate predictors for full-time employment after graduation. Many of these same factors had a high correlation with starting salary; however, surprisingly, participation in college organizations showed some correlation, but to a weaker extent. Another paper from the Journal of Vocational Behavior<sup><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"ref2\">2</a></sup> studied the effectiveness of internship experiences on work placement post graduation. While this paper had some interesting findings questioning the effectiveness of internships, they lacked a data-driven approach that would be of much use to our project. Going forward, it would be beneficial to look for research that studies the efficacy of academic and co-curricular factors in multiple fields so we can draw conclusions for multiple industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, others examined whether internships directly translate to employment and job advantages. Nunley et al. (2016)<sup><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"ref3\">3</a></sup> analyze the outcomes of students obtaining internships early on in their career, which is associated with a higher likelihood of receiving a job offer after graduation. This is especially the case when the internship is relevant to the field the student is going into or studying. This demonstrates that internships are a signal to employers of having readily equipped skills that their education alone does not prepare them for. However, this article does not account for how various factors interact across various industries and which of these factors matter more for hiring purposes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although prior research highlights the importance of academic and experiential factors, much of the previous research done on this field focuses on a narrow population or focuses on one sole predictor on employability. There is limited work on the importance of applying employability to a larger scale as well as using multiple predictors across various industries using a Data Science approach. Our project aims to address this gap by examining multiple futures like GPA, internship experience, skills, and other factors jointly correlate to employment outcomes. We hope that this project will give insights to students looking for work experience and to guide them in what to focus on in their professional development.\n",

We predict that certain factors have more weight on a student’s employment success. We would either like to compare these relationships against each other or combine them and compare their employment outcomes across various industries, since different jobs require different skill sets. Due to our multifaceted question, we proposed two different hypothesis sets, with Aim 1 being our primary and Aim 2 being our secondary.\n"

    "Ideally our data would focus on two main topics: a student’s academic profile and job listings. For ideal data on students, our observations would be university students and our variables/columns would focus on students’ GPA, technical and soft skills, extracurriculars, achievements and awards, and any previous employment/internships, all stored in a Pandas DataFrame. One idea of ours is to use this data to calculate achievement scores and use those for our predictions. Our current plan to obtain this data is to scrape linkedin and other sites where students can post their academic profile. Our ideal job listing data would contain observations from different companies and variables including education level, GPA,  skills, and university. This data would be collected from Kaggle or scraped from various job boards like Indeed and stored in a dataframe. We would then perform exploratory data analysis on these dataframes to standardize them in a way where we can use the data to identify insightful relationships/correlations and make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first dataset we found is located on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/babambum/job-market-data. This dataset contains information scraped from one of India’s largest job portals. It’s public use, since it’s posted fully visible on kaggle. The most important column in this dataset is the skills column, where each job posting lists required skills for the job, comma separated. We will definitely use this information along with the salary and experience required columns to find the most sought after skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset we found is also located on kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushagrathisside/student-skillset-analysis. Again, it’s public use and ready for use. This dataset contains information about undergraduate students and their academic backgrounds and skillsets. This dataset will be useful for seeing the empirical distributions of variables of interest, such as Major and Location of school."

    "## Ethics \n",
    "\n",
    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our data will be either taken directly from Kaggle or scraped from LinkedIn. Using the LinkedIn API, we will be using publicly available information such as an individual’s work experience, skillsets, projects, and other profile traits. In doing so, information from each subject is not explicitly consented for, but since we are not asking for new information of them or having to interact with the participant at all, LinkedIn’s API privacy settings and the information that is able to be accessed from there is available for use. Since we might be scraping LinkedIn, every person whose data we will be obtaining data has made this information available for everyone to see. So, while the participants may have consented to putting their information on LinkedIn, they have not explicitly stated consent for their data to be used in the study. We’ll handle issues on a case-by-case basis, eliminating certain variables if we deem them too unsafe or biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will try to obtain data that is diverse and representative of the unique population we sample and try to factor in social, cultural, and economic backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Employment outcomes are sometimes shaped by other external factors such as educational, networking, and socioeconomic background which is not represented in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There could be a lot of biases perpetuated in our data, like how certain demographics are less likely to be hired due to existing prejudice, which we will have to deal with. When we perform our tests and analyses, we’ll be able to spot out variables with high significance that result from human biases. \n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will try to select accurate and thoughtful data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is the instance that we are comparing job qualifications to people who have jobs already and we acknowledge that it is difficult to get data and therefore research the alternative side of people with certain skill sets failing to get certain jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    " > We will compare model performance across the various groups and report any disparities between them.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    " > Our prediction model could be misused and could either give false hope or a false alarm to those using the model externally outside of this project, depending on a positive or negative outcome. We acknowledge that the model is for academic purposes and not to be applied in a real-life scenario or job hiring decision-making.\n"
